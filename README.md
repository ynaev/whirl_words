# WhirlWords 🌀🧠
WhirlWords is a Python-powered Boggle-style word game where players try to find hidden words in a dynamically generated letter grid.

## 🧠 Game Concept
- A set number of dice, each with custom faces, are used to generate a grid of random letters.
- A dictionary of valid English words is loaded.
- Words are found by "snaking" through adjacent letters (8 directions allowed).
- You can tweak the number of dice and faces to increase difficulty.
